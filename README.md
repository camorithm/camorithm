💡 Philosophy
"Every product starts as an idea, but not every idea becomes a product. I help ideas find form."

From inception to final commit, I build ML systems that solve real-world problems at scale.

⭐️ From camorithm | Building the future with algorithms

Fun fact: I've taught AI to spend advertising budgets more efficiently than humans, and scaled businesses from concept to exit using data-driven decision making.
